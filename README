== DESCRIPTION:

GeoRuby-Extras Gem for Ruby (c) 2008 David Troy
dave@roundhousetech.com

GeoRuby offers OGC-compliant simple features for Ruby as well as the ability to
process SHP files and do other cool GIS hacks.  GeoRuby is often used in conjunction
with GIS extensions to databases.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Provides native C implementation of Vincenty distance and direct algorithms.
* 25 times faster than GeoRuby 'ellipsoidal_distance' function.
* Adds the Vincenty 'direct' algorithm (point_at_bearing_and_distance).
* No known problems; won't work with JRuby or non-MRI Ruby implementations.

== SYNOPSIS:

require 'rubygems'
require 'geo_ruby'
require 'georuby-extras'

@home = Point.from_lon_lat(-76.511,39.024)
@nyc = Point.from_lon_lat(-74,40.6)

>> @home.ellipsoidal_distance(@nyc)
=> 277195.510448391

>> @home.point_at_bearing_and_distance(91.0, 130000.0).kml_representation
=> "<Point>\n<coordinates>-75.0105920700835,38.9939120193168</coordinates>\n</Point>\n"

== REQUIREMENTS:

* GCC and a Gnu-ish build environment (for native extensions)

== INSTALLATION

3) Profit!
